Energy Totals ID (Foreign Key)

The U.S. Energy Information Administration website provides a yearly dataset of energy totals for each US state with a breakdown of energy
sources (e.g fossil fuels, renewable energy, etc…). I wanted to focus on popular mainstream energy sources and see how they fluctuate 
across the country. Table 1 provides important basic information in each of its columns. These include the state, year, total energy 
statistics, and a randomly generated ID code. The state column will only accept string data with a length of two (i.e. state abbreviations)
while every other column will be float/integer values.

The second table will include columns with the total consumption values from the popular mainstream energy sources, such as coal, natural 
gas, petroleum, renewable energy, and nuclear energy. These columns will only accept data in float format. The last column will be 
table 2’s foreign key, which is the randomly generated ID code from table 1. This will link important information such as state/ year with
all types of consumption data found in table 2.
